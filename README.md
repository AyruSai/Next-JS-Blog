# Next.js Blog Project

This project is a simple **blog application** built using [Next.js Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router).  
I created this while following the official Next.js tutorial to gain an understanding of the fundamentals of building full-stack applications with Next.js.

## About the Project

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes it easier to build production-ready applications by providing:

- **File-based routing** with support for dynamic routes  
- **Pre-rendering** (Static Generation & Server-Side Rendering)  
- **Automatic code splitting** for faster performance  
- **API routes** to create backend endpoints with serverless functions  
- **Built-in CSS/Sass support** (with the flexibility to use any CSS-in-JS library)  
- **Fast Refresh** for a smooth developer experience  

This blog project demonstrates these concepts in practice.
